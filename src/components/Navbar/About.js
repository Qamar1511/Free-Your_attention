In today's digital age, our attention is under constant assault. From flashing notifications to endless social media feeds, staying focused and present can feel like an uphill battle. That's where Free Your Attention comes in.</p>

<h1 className="about">Our Story</h1>
<p className="para">
We were founded by a group of passionate individuals who shared a common frustration: the feeling of being constantly pulled in a million different directions, never fully engaged in anything. We knew there had to be a better way to manage our attention and live more mindful lives.

So, we set out to create a platform that would empower people to take back control of their focus. We wanted to build a resource that was accessible, effective, and, most importantly, inspiring.</p>

<h1 className="about">Our Mission</h1>
<p className="para">
Our mission is to help people cultivate focused minds and mindful lives. We believe that everyone deserves to experience the clarity, calm, and productivity that come with a well-trained attention.</p>

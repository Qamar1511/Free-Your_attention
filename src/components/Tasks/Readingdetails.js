        <p>"Reading is a wonderful way to relax the mind and escape into different worlds. Choose a book that captivates your interest and spend 15 minutes immersed in its pages. Find a comfortable spot, grab a cozy blanket, and let the words transport you. Whether it's fiction, non-fiction, or a self-help book, reading stimulates the mind, improves focus, and provides a welcome break from daily stress."</p>
